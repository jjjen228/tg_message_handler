You first need to run the authentication file to login to your account, unfortunately this step is very difficult to automate.
In .env or Docker files, adjust your parameters, including those in them, in addition to the Postgre parameters, so that they are not affected by default. 
There may be problems with access to the server, but not every time. It is possible that there is was problems with networking on my device, so can`t say for sure.
